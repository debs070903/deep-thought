This is the Website for Task 1, based on the Figma design. This is a hard-coded website built using HTML and CSS with some basic JS for functionality.
Building the website was challenging. It was a great learning experience and I enjoyed the preocess which helped me to increase my HTML and CSS skills a bit more.
Here is the link to view the web-site: https://deep-thought.netlify.app/
